*AnimationEvent.js

A simple utility script that generates pseudo-constants for CSS animation and transition events, so you don't have to worry about vendor prefixes.

Link to AnimationEvents.js in your source code, then use the following syntax :

`element.addEventListener( TRANSITION_END, myTransitionEndHandler, false );

Available values :
TRANSITION_END
ANIMATION_START
ANIMATION_ITERATION
ANIMATION_END
